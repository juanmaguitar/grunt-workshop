## Some tips for the workshop

- To [start using Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) we should have installed in our machine Node.js (>= 0.8.0. ) and NPM
- Remember that **first thing to do to start using grunt** is installing the CLI package globally → `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- If you have issues when launching `npm install` in existing projects remember to check the writable permissions of that folder
- If you have issues w/ the [grunt-contrib-compass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass) have a look at [these solutions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23042166/grunt-contrib-sass-not-working-with-compass)

## Extra tips

### Default values for package.json

We can set default values for our _package.json_ so they are automatically filled when we use  → `npm init`

    $ npm config set init.author.name "JuanMa Garrido"
    $ npm config set init.author.email JuanMa.Garrido@gmail.com
    $ npm config set init.author.url http://apuntesjs.com
    $ npm config set init.license MIT

### Project Scaffolding

Start quickly grunt projects w/ [project-scaffolding](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding)

    npm install -g grunt-init
    git clone https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-gruntfile.git ~/.grunt-init/gruntfile
    grunt-init gruntfile
